# ZWAL : Rethinking Write-ahead Logs for ZNS SSDs

ZWAL is a new WAL design for ZNS that uses `zone appends` instead of `writes`. It leads to significantly higher write throughput and concurrency compared to writes without resorting to excessive buffering I/O on the host. The implementation is build on top of [ZenFS](https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/zenfs).

This code is part of the [ZWAL: Rethinking Write-ahead Logs for ZNS SSDs]() paper at the "4th Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems".

# Dependencies

ZWALs have the same requirements as ZenFS, but additionally requires the SimpleZNSDevice library (SZD) and Linux with support for io_uring with NVMe passthrough (> 6.0).

* [libzbd](https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/libzbd)
* [SZD](https://github.com/Krien/SimpleZNSDevice/tree/io-uring)
* RocksDB v6.19.3 or later
* Linux 6.0 or later

# Build and use ZWALs

## Clone ZWAL with required submodules

First clone the source base with all submodules included:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stonet-research/zwal.git --recursive
```

## Install dependencies

Install libzbd (tested on `0ab157e`):

```sh
pushd libzbd
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
popd
```

Install SZD (use the `io_uring` branch):

```sh
pushd SimpleZNSDevice
# Setup SPDK and DPDK (we will not use them, but SZD needs them for dependencies)
cd dependencies/spdk
./scripts/pkgdep.sh
./configure
make -j
sudo make install
cd ..

mkdir -p build && cd build
rm -f CMakeCache.txt
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Configure and build ZWAL

ZWALs come with a number of configuration options that are defined in `#define` directives.
These must be set before compilation (also see `build.sh` on examples). Apart from this the build is no different from ZenFS. ZWALs *do* require a specific change in RocksDB, hence we ship RocksDB along with ZWALs (see `rocksdb-raw`).

```bash
rm -rf rocksdb-raw/plugin/zenfs
cp -r zenfs-appends rocksdb-raw/plugin/zenfs

# Set WAL buffersize
BUFFSIZE=4
sed -i "s/#define SPARSE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_KB.*/#define SPARSE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_KB ${BUFFSIZE}UL/g" rocksdb-raw/plugin/zenfs/fs/io_zenfs.h

# set WAL max depth
MAXWALDEPTH=32
sed -i "s/NAMELESS_WAL_DEPTH.*/NAMELESS_WAL_DEPTH ${MAXWALDEPTH}/g" rocksdb-raw/plugin/zenfs/fs/zbd_zenfs.h

# Set WAL barriersize
WALBARRIERSIZE=16384
sed -i "s/#define WAL_BARRIER_SIZE_IN_KB.*/#define WAL_BARRIER_SIZE_IN_KB ${WALBARRIERSIZE}UL/g" rocksdb-raw/plugin/zenfs/fs/io_zenfs.h

cd rocksdb-raw
DEBUG_LEVEL=0 ROCKSDB_PLUGINS=zenfs make -j48 db_bench
sudo DEBUG_LEVEL=0 ROCKSDB_PLUGINS=zenfs make install

cd plugin/zenfs/util
make

# NOTE: if the install fails, please check if both SPDK and ZBD are installed correctly. To double-check try the install procedure with `cp -r zenfs-default` as well. 
```

# Formatting a ZenFS file system with ZWALs enabled

The formatting procedure is the same as for ZenFS. However, we only evaluated extensively under the default configuration of:

```bash
echo deadline | sudo tee /sys/class/block/<zoned block device>/queue/scheduler
rocksdb-raw/plugin/zenfs/util/zenfs mkfs --zbd=<zoned block device> --aux_path=<path to store LOG and LOCK files>
```

We provide no guarantees for other ZenFS functionalities.

# Artifact Evaluation

To reproduce the results of our paper, follow the instuctions in [AE.md](AE.md).

# Structure of this repository

* `AE.md`: Artifact Evaluation. Contains a description of how to reproduce all results from the paper.
* `zenfs-appends`: ZenFS with ZWALs implemented.
* `zenfs-default`: Standard ZenFS (included for easy experimentation). We added support for variable buffer sizes (change `SPARSE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_KB` in `fs/io_zenfs.h`).
* `rocksdb-raw`: RocksDB modified to delete WALs instantly instead of archiving them.
* `rocksdb-ycsb`: The same as `rocksdb-raw`, but always forces RocksDB to use ZenFS, and forces some options (`WAL_size`). Necessary to use with YCSB.
* `ycsb`: The YCSB benchmark, modified to support RocksDB with ZenFS
* `data`: raw data from all our experiments
* `fio-with-appends`: fio modified to support appends for io_uring with NVMe passthrough
